    "- Interpretation: We reject the null hypothesis, indicating significant risk differences in claim frequency across provinces. For example, Gauteng exhibits a 20% higher claim frequency compared to the Western Cape, likely due to higher traffic density or urban risk factors.\n",
    "- Recommendation: Adjust premium rates regionally, increasing premiums in high-risk provinces like Gauteng by approximately 15-20% to reflect the elevated claim frequency, while maintaining or slightly reducing rates in lower-risk areas like the Western Cape.\n",
